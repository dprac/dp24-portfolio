    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Daven Prachan.  I am a Lao-American multidisciplinary artist.</p>
    <p>I practice traditional illustration, painting, digital illustration, film editing, and photography.</p>

    <p>My works involve evoking discussions around mental health, personal awareness, temporality, and identities.</p>
    <p>Aside from these themes, I believe that the arts in general  
      can help elevate struggles of the marginalized and issues often unseen in our everyday world. </p>

  <div id="illustrationContent" style="display: none;">
    <h1>Illustration</h1>
   <p>Illustration is my most developed art practice. I have experience in graphite, charcoal, and paint mediums. </p>

    <h2> Neo Gentifrication, 2021, Graphite on Paper</h2>

    <p>Arygle Alley and Uptown as a whole have special places in my heart as places that have  
    shaped my childhood. I think of the stretches of Vietnamese, Thai, and other South East Asian buisnesses  
    with fond nostalgia. Unfortunately, rapid urban developments, alongside closures during covid, have created  
    the opportunities for gentrification to emerge in this area. I wanted to capture the rapid pace of this cultural    
    erasure in all of its violence.</p>

    <h2> Ma Noi, 2023, Graphite on Gray Tone Paper</h2>

    <p>This work is a self portrait of sorts, based on my childhood nickname, "Ma Noi."  
    This nickname roughly translates to "puppy", and it was given to me when I was a much more rambunctious child.  
    I still feel like as an adult I am still seen as the puppy I was before, while still carrying the burdens of   
    a grown up life. Just as the dog is blamed for eating homework, I too see myself baring unreasonable faults.</p>

    <h2>Important Question, 2024, coding via p5.js </h2>

    <p>During my last semester at UIC, I saw myself drowning in an overwhelming sea of mental health struggles.  
    I was struggling to learn coding at the time, and aside from my already strong seasonal depression, I was  
    also personally crushed by learning of my grandmother's failing health. I felt I there were days that I would be   
    running on autopilot. I reflected upon these feelings and sought to manifest it through the imagery of a "software gore".
    A broken screen will reveal bleeding LEDs, and this work similarly reveals how broken I felt in this time. </p>

    <p> Pet The Dog, 2024, Narrative Game built on Twine.</p>
    <p> This game, called "Pet the Dog" is an average, run of the mill, dog petting simulatator.  
    The themes of temorality, dreams, and narrative agency are definately not at play in this completely normal game.</p>
    <p> You can play it here: <a href="https://dprac.github.io/Project-3">Pet the Dog</a> . </p>

    <h2>Breaking News, 2024, html webpage </h2>

    <p> My semester progressed and I saw continued mental strain. My grandmother passed away and I had amassed a backlog of work  
    in all of my classes. I was fortunate to recieve support, but I realized that I had to go long stretches out of my way
    to do so. I believe that there are mental health stigmas in my community, as well as persistent stereotypes that affect  
    how likely people in my community are to recieve help. I felt that a piece of satire could best illustrate my feelings on how neglicted I felt   
    my mental health issues were being addressed as an Asian American, so I wrote this article,     
    which can be read  <a href="https://dprac.github.io/ChiTribFake/"><strong>here.</strong></a>

    <h2> Wanderer, 2019, Digital Photography</h2>
    <br>
    <p> This is a series of photographs taken before the onset of the global pandemic. The titlar wanderer reflects the state I felt at the time being in the   
    middle of my 20-something life. Sometimes I feel that my life can seem aimless, or that I am constantly someone that is out of place or  
    out of time. I still feel this way about my life, though I think being a wanderer does not have to be a bad thing from time to time.
