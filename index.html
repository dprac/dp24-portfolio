    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Daven Prachan.  I am a Lao-American multidisciplinary artist.</p>
    <p>I practice traditional illustration, painting, digital illustration, film editing, and photography.</p>

    <p>My works involve evoking discussions around mental health, personal awareness, temporality, and identities.</p>
    <p>Aside from these themes, I believe that the arts in general  
      can help elevate struggles of the marginalized and issues often unseen in our everyday world. </p>

    <h2>Illustration</h2>
   <p>Illustration is my most developed art practice. I have experience in graphite, charcoal, and paint mediums. </p>

    <p> Neo Gentifrication, 2021, Graphite on Paper</p>

    <p>Arygle Alley and Uptown as a whole have special places in my heart as places that have  
    shaped my childhood. I think of the stretches of Vietnamese, Thai, and other South East Asian buisnesses  
    with fond nostalgia. Unfortunately, rapid urban developments, alongside closures during covid, have created  
    the opportunities for gentrification to emerge in this area. I wanted to capture the rapid pace of this cultural    
    erasure in all of its violence.</p>

    <p> Ma Noi, 2023, Graphite on Gray Tone Paper</p>

    <p>This work is a self portrait of sorts, based on my childhood nickname, "Ma Noi."  
    This nickname roughly translates to "puppy", and it was given to me when I was a much more rambunctious child.  
    I still feel like as an adult I am still seen as the puppy I was before, while still carrying the burdens of   
    a grown up life. Just as the dog is blamed for eating homework, I too see myself baring unreasonable faults.</p>
